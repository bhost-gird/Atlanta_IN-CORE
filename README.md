# Atlanta IN-CORE
An applied research paper by Cole Reardon, dual masters student in City and Regional Planning and GIS at Georgia Tech. Application of IN-CORE disaster modeling system to Atlanta Metro Area. 

This project seeks to use the interdependent networked community resilience modeling environment (IN-CORE) to assess how flooding impacts the suburbs surrounding Atlanta. Understanding how disasters will impact communities around Atlanta is a vital first step to planning for disaster and climate resilience amongst those communities.
